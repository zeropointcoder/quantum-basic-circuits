# quantum-basic-circuits (Quantum Basic Circuits)

## Goal

To create, simulate, and visualise a basic quantum circuit using **Qiskit**, the leading open-source quantum SDK from IBM.

## STEPS

1. Creates a quantum circuit with **one qubit** and **one classical bit**.  
2. Applies a **Hadamard gate (H)** to put the qubit into superposition ‚Äî i.e., both `|0‚ü©` and `|1‚ü©` at once.  
3. Measures the qubit, which collapses it randomly to `|0‚ü©` or `|1‚ü©`.  
4. Runs the simulation 1000 times using the **Aer simulator** to observe the probability distribution.  
5. Visualises:
   - The quantum circuit diagram.
   - The measurement results as a histogram.


## üì¶ Requirements

Required: **Python 3.9+**, with dependencies:

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer matplotlib pylatexenc
